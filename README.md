## Data-Visualization
This folder contains R scripts for visualizing omics datasets. The scripts cover commonly used plots for differential expression analysis and downstream data exploration, including:
- PCA Plot
- Volcano Plot
- Heatmaps
- UpSet Plots
- Annotated Heatmaps: Annotated heatmaps are great way to visualize diffrentially expressed genes/metabolites based on their pathway annotation data. 

The plots are generated using ggplot2, ComplexHeatmap, and other widely-used R visualization packages.
